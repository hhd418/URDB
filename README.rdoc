This is the URDB app. We are creatinng a similar site to IMDB and will be listing the top movies.

The app uses ruby on rails and uses sqlite3 as the database for Active Record. We also added one of our favorite gems Hirb to improve the viewing of the database in the console.

Check it out and let me know what you think!
